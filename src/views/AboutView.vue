        My name is Abubakar Abdullahi, a passionate Data Analyst with a
        deep-seated curiosity for Big Data and Analystics, Artificial Intelligence, software engineering and
        machine learning.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-3 text-gray-500">
        As a Data Analyst, I am passionate about working with organizations that want to make
        effective use of their data; from what you want to measure and how to capture data
        accurately through data preparation, analysis and management, all the way to impactful
        presentation of insights. I can support each step of the process to enable organization in
        making evidence-driven decisions or share findings/insights with audiences with analytical
        and visualization tools such as Microsoft power-bi, python, SQL, MySQL, Excel, Jupyter notebook, and Oracle
        Databases, which allows me to transform and handle complex datasets into meaningful
        information.

        I am available for full-term, short-term projects and part-time longer-term engagements.
